## Influenza season 2018–2019 in Europe 

The visualization shows how the influenza epidemic spread from December 2018 to May 2019 in Europe. The map represents the intensity of the epidemic. Each country on each week is presented with a colour representing the status of the epidemic. The level of the intensity is divided into 5 levels: 
1. Baseline
2. Low
3. Medium
4. High
5. Very High

**Baseline** is presented with lighter blue and **Very high** with the most intense blue.

It has been studied why influenza is more common during the winter. There are a couple of reasons. First, it has been suggested that while people spend more time inside it is easier for the virus to spread from person to person. Second, it has been studied that in cold air the virus freezes in the air and has more time to spread from person to person. In warm air the virus disassembles before it has time to attach itself to a new person.
